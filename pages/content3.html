                        <li class="deb">Take Your Time.
                            Instead of quickly agreeing to do something you'd rather not do, pause and take a few deep breaths.</li>
                        
                        <li class="deb">Consider Your Reasons.
                            When you're faced with a choice, ask yourself what your reasons are for doing something. </li>
                        <li class="deb">Set Boundaries.
                            Saying "no" can be hard, but it's necessary to set healthy boundaries in relationships. If someone persistently pressures you to do something, you can try telling them how it affects you.</li>
                        <li class="deb">Offer an Alternative.
                            It's possible that a friend who is peer pressuring you simply wants to spend more time with you or connect with you, but they don't know how else to ask.</li>

                      <div class="deb">Peer pressure can influence a person to do something that is relatively harmless or something that has more serious consequences. Giving in to the pressure to dress a certain way is one thing â€” going along with the crowd to drink or smoke is another.</div>
